## Setup

**Download Composer dependencies**  
Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/) 
and then run:   
```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.  


**Check packages:**
```
composer require
```
**Start the built-in web server**
```
php bin/console server:run
```

**Start local Apache web server with  MariaDB database server**
```angular2html
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
```

**Create doctrine database**
```angular2html
./bin/console doctrine:database:create
```

## Somebody Has To

Somebody has to go polish the stars,
They're looking a little bit dull.
Somebody has to go polish the stars,
For the eagles and starlings and gulls
Have all been complaining they're tarnished and worn,
They say they want new ones we cannot afford.
So please get your rags
And your polishing jars,
Somebody has to go polish the stars.

Shel Silverstein
